Helps in Finding Lost pets!
To run the Lost & Found Pet Application, ensure Node.js is installed and MongoDB is running locally. 
First, navigate to the backend directory in the terminal, install the dependencies using npm install, and start the server -
with npm start. The backend will operate on http://localhost:5000. Next, navigate to the frontend directory and open the index.html file in a browser to launch the frontend. 
The application interface allows adding, viewing, updating, and deleting pet information.
